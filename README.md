## ESPhome - Jura Impressa E8
This is an ESPhome custom component to communicate with a Jura Impressa J6 coffee machine.  It may also work with other serially-controlled Jura models with minimal adjustment.

It allows monitoring and control via HomeAssistant:

Hardware is a Wemos D1 Mini connected to the 7-pin Jura service port via a 3.3V<->5V logic level converter.\
The D1 mini is powered from the Jura.

If you have diffuculty, try swapping the TX/RX pins.

The D1 Mini and level converter are placed in an enclosure screwed to the back of the Jura, hidden out of the way.

Internal connections to the service connector wires are done with "T" tap/splices, leaving the connector itself alone.

Commands for your machine can be generated using the provided script, `generate_esphome_jura_yaml.py`.  It requires the `bitarray` Python module to be installed.

      $ ./generate_esphome_jura_yaml.py AN:01

            - uart.write: [0xDF, 0xDB, 0xDB, 0xDF]  ## 'A'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xFB, 0xFF, 0xDB, 0xDF]  ## 'N'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xFB, 0xFB, 0xFF, 0xDB]  ## ':'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xDB, 0xDB, 0xFF, 0xDB]  ## '0'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xDF, 0xDB, 0xFF, 0xDB]  ## '1'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xDF, 0xFF, 0xDB, 0xDB]  ## '\r'
            - delay: 8ms
            - uart.write: [0xFB, 0xFB, 0xDB, 0xDB]  ## '\n'

Particular commands seem to vary by model.\
These work on the Impressa J6, software `TY: PIM V01.01`, `TL: LOADER V3.0`.
Command | Action
--- | ---
AN:01 | Switch On
AN:02 | Switch Off
FA:01 | Switch off, including rinse
AN:0D | Tray Test? Or date related?
FA:02 | Heat up water
FA:03 | Heat up water & Make steam?
FA:06 | Make hot water
FA:07 | Make 1 Espresso
FA:08 | Make 2 Espressi
FA:09 | Make 1 Coffee
FA:0A | Make 2 Coffees
FA:0B | Cup illumination light comes on. Also exits menu system.
FA:0C | Enters the menu system - displays RINSE as the first option
FA:0D | Cycles through menu options [dial counter-clockwise]
FA:OE | Cycles through menu options clockwise [dial-clockwise]
FA:0F | Reads "B. Full", Freezes up
DA:16 | Shows the final two digits on the display, i.e. "16.."

#### To-Do:
- Determine how to initiate a Force Rinse action on this model
- Status of "Fill Beans", "Need Cleaning", and "Need Flushing"
- Actual machine power state (currently we use an 'Optimistic', 'Assumed State' Template switch in ESPhome)
